Follow the steps:
- clone this project
- run `composer install`
- run `php script.php`
- run `composer run test`

The 7th row has 0.69 value because I round the commission at the very end which I think is the correct way. That way we don't have a loss of data, amirite. 
The last row is slightly different because of the fluctuating rates of EUR to JPY.
